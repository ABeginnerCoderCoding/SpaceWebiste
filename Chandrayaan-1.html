        <h2>Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar exploration mission, and it marked a significant milestone in the country's space exploration efforts. Launched on October 22, 2008, by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Chandrayaan-1 was a lunar orbiter designed to study the Moon from orbit and conduct various scientific experiments.

            <br>
            Key features and achievements of Chandrayaan-1:
            <br>
            Payload: Chandrayaan-1 carried a suite of 11 scientific instruments, including spectrometers, imagers, and radar equipment, to investigate the Moon's surface and its mineral composition.
            <br>
            Lunar Orbit: The spacecraft was initially placed in a highly elliptical orbit around the Moon. After several orbit-raising maneuvers, it reached a polar orbit at an altitude of about 100 km, allowing for comprehensive lunar observation.
            <br>
            Discovery of Water: One of the most significant discoveries of Chandrayaan-1 was the confirmation of water molecules on the lunar surface. This discovery challenged earlier assumptions that the Moon was entirely dry and raised the possibility of utilizing lunar resources for future lunar missions.
            <br>
            Mapping the Moon: Chandrayaan-1 generated detailed 3D maps of the lunar surface, helping scientists understand the topography, mineral distribution, and geology of the Moon.
            <br>
            Impact of ISRO: The success of Chandrayaan-1 not only advanced lunar science but also demonstrated India's capabilities in space exploration. It put India on the map as a serious player in space research and garnered international recognition.
            <br>
            Unexpected End: The mission was originally planned to last two years, but it was cut short in August 2009 when contact with the spacecraft was lost. It was later confirmed that Chandrayaan-1 had suffered a communication failure. Despite this early end, the mission provided valuable data for scientific research.
            <br>
            Legacy: Chandrayaan-1's success paved the way for subsequent Indian lunar missions, including Chandrayaan-2, which aimed to explore the Moon more extensively by deploying a lander and rover in addition to an orbiter. Chandrayaan-2 was launched in 2019 and further solidified India's presence in lunar exploration.
            <br>
            Chandrayaan-1 was a groundbreaking mission that significantly contributed to our understanding of the Moon, particularly with its discovery of water molecules on the lunar surface. It demonstrated India's technological prowess in space exploration and set the stage for further ambitious missions in the field of planetary science.
