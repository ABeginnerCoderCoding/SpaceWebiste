            Launch and Mission Objectives:
            <br>
            Voyager 1 was launched aboard a Titan IIIE/Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
            The primary mission objectives included studying Jupiter and Saturn and their moons, rings, and magnetospheres.
            Flybys:
            <br>
            Voyager 1 conducted a close flyby of Jupiter in March 1979, providing valuable data and images of the planet and its moons.
            In November 1980, it performed a close approach to Saturn, sending back detailed information about the planet, its rings, and its moons.
            Interstellar Mission:
            <br>
            After completing its primary mission, Voyager 1 continued its journey towards the outer reaches of the Solar System.
            On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 officially entered interstellar space, becoming the first human-made object to do so. It crossed the heliopause, the boundary where the influence of the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind diminishes.
            Golden Record:
            <br>
            Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 carry a Golden Record, a phonograph record containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth. This was intended as a message to any extraterrestrial intelligence that might encounter the probes.
            Current Status:
            <br>
            As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Voyager 1 continues its journey into interstellar space, providing valuable data about the conditions in the outer regions of our galaxy. Keep in mind that this information may be outdated, and I recommend checking the latest sources for the most current status of Voyager 1.
            Voyager 1 has become a symbol of human exploration and scientific achievement, providing insights into the mysteries of our solar system and venturing beyond into the vastness of interstellar space.
